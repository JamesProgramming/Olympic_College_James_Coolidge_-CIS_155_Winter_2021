       <h1>Sand Everything Smooth</h1>
       <p>Varnish and paint doesn't cover up rough surfaces. 
          It actually make them more apparent. Sanding surfaces 
          smooth is one of most important elements to making professional woodwork.</p>
       
               
       <h1>Laminate Woods with Alike Hardness</h1>
       <p>Woods with different hardness require different 
          levels of sandpaper grit to be smoothed out. When you come sand your wooden creation, 
          the softer wood will remove faster than the hard one making an wave pattern with the softer wood lower the harder wood.</p>
       
       
       <h1>Clap Your Wood Tight</h1>
       <p>The strength of the bond depends on how much force is placed on keep the wood together while it's gluing.</p>
       
       
       <h1>Wood Glue and Varnish Don't Bond</h1>
       <p>You must make sure that there is no varnish on the wood you are gluing. 
          If you use a board that has varnish on it, sand it until the varnish is thoroughly gone.</p>
       
       
       <h1>Save The Sawdust</h1>
       <p>When your doing a wood project, save some of the sawdust for each of the woods you used. 
          This makes great putty since it is the exact same color as the wood your using. All you need to do is 
          mix it with some clear glue and fill in the cracks.</p>
